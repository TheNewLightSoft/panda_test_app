/// ## ChatService Use Case
///
/// **Purpose:**  
/// This file is part of the **Use Cases** layer in the Clean Architecture and is responsible for managing the logic related to local chat storage and retrieval.
///
/// **Potential functionalities to implement:**  
/// - **Local storage of chat messages:** Store chat messages locally to ensure offline access and caching.  
/// - **Message synchronization:** Synchronize local messages with the server when the connection is restored.  
/// - **Message retrieval:** Retrieve chat history from local storage to ensure fast loading times.  
/// - **Message deletion:** Provide a method for clearing chat history when needed (e.g., user logout).  
///
/// This file establishes the foundation for handling chat data efficiently, enabling smooth offline access and reducing server load by leveraging local storage.
