/// ## AuthService Use Case
///
/// **Purpose:**  
/// This file is part of the **Use Cases** layer in the Clean Architecture and is responsible for handling the logic related to user authentication.
///
/// **Potential functionalities to implement:**  
/// - **Token storage:** Save the access token after successful user authentication.  
/// - **Token refresh:** Update the access token when a new token is received from the server (for example, using a refresh token).  
/// - **Token removal:** Delete the access token when the user logs out of their account.  
/// - **Token validation:** Check for the presence of a valid token to determine if the user is authenticated.  
///
/// This file establishes the foundation for a scalable and maintainable authentication logic, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easy extension for future requirements.
